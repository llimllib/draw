Gonna try to poke python-sounddevice a bit. [Example programs](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.0/examples.html)

`bleepy.py`: plays an A by default, and swaps for a C when you hit the space bar. Next up: get an oscillator class working, support more notes, stop the popping

`osc.py`: attempst to re√∂rganize the code to move oscillator into a class
