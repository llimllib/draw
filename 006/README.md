`bloop.py` is the first thing I made that actually plays back reasonable notes, and you can even make chords, wahoo

`synthesizer.py` is a hacked-up version of pyglet's synthesizer that does not work at all

`simple_demo.py` shows how to connect numpy to a playing sound(s)

`scales.py` maps midi notes to frequencies
